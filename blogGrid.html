         <p class="postOnlyContent">Today is really rough, got a major headache. Albeit, it could be worse, I could have a worse headache like I was having the other day. Anxiety still getting to me, though not as bad as it used to be so... yay? I'm not operating at peak capacity like I would like to, but I still function. That's not nothing. I just wish that the anxiety would quell and give me a chance at peace of mind.</p>
